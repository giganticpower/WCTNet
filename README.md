# WCTNet
Multi-level Contexts Weighted Coupling Transformer (WCTNet),  for UHR segmentation. 

In this paper, we propose Multi-level Contexts Weighted Coupling Transformer (WCTNet), to develop an efficient framework for UHR segmentation. Previous approaches divide UHR images into regular patches for multi-scale local segmentation. Hierarchical reasoning leads to an urgent dilemma between memory efficiency and segmentation quality. To improve it, this paper proposes Multi-level Feature Weighting (MFW) module and Token-based Transformer (TT) to weight and couple multi-level semantic contexts. 

WCTNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on two UHR datasets including DeepGlobe and Inria Aerial. Experimental results show that this contextual weighting and coupling of single-scale patches enables WCTNet to balance its accuracy and computational overhead well.
